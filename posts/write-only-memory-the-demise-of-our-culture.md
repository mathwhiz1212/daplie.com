**Warning**: I'm going to give an analogy that sounds like it has to do with computers, but that's not where I'm going with this. **Just keep reading**.

Back in 1973 the term "[Write-Only Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-only_memory_(joke))" was first printed in a legitimate computer [parts](http://www.ganssle.com/misc/wom1.jpg) [catalog](http://www.ganssle.com/misc/wom1.jpg) as an April Fool's prank.

For reference, a CD-ROM (Read-Only Memory, ROM) is a disc that you write information to only once
(before it even gets to the store) and then it can never be written again.
This is nice.
It's why you never hear stories of people accidentally recording over your CDs, DVDs, etc
like they used to sometimes do with video tapes.
ROM is useful.

The opposite would be the idea of something that can only be written to and not read again later; a WOM.
In practice this would be useless because it's merely a synonym for deleting.
In fact, in 1982 Apple extended the joke by adding the term "bit bucket" (i.e. trash bin)
as a formal synonym for WOM in their [Apple IIe manual](http://www.applelogic.org/files/AIIEREF.pdf#page=250).
IBM had to have a laugh too, so they revived it in 1995 for one of their catalogs
(and, oddly enough, there actually were customers who called in to purchase the non-existant and useless part!)

But now the joke is on us: We live in a WOM world with a Write-Only culture.
More and more of our mediums of expression and art are turning into bit buckets.

The Facebook feed is the perfect metaphor for this.
Or maybe not even a metaphor, maybe it's simply the clearest and most blatant evidence.

Realize with me, just for a moment, that the "Post to Friends" button would be more accurately labeled
"Delete to Friends" (and similar could be said of any "Stream to Device" button).

Given, 99.97% of all content is crap -
this applies to Music, Books, Movies, and other forms of Art -
but, really, that's okay.
I think that most content being crap is pretty normal and not very unique to our time.

The problem is that there is no preservation of content.
The 99.97% and the 00.03% get *deleted to* the same Facebook wall
and moments later there is something else to replace it.

There's no sense of curation or permanence.
Everything goes to the same ephemeral bit bucket in the cloud.
We're not saving the 00.03%.
We're not saving the 99.97%.
Sure, some of the popular buzzfeed retweets are stalled a little longer on their journey,
but it all meets the same end.
We're clicking the Delete to Friends button on 100.00% of the content.
The number of views and shares is nothing more than gunk clogging up the plumbing as it slowly goes down the drain.

But this isn't just a Facebook wall problem.
It's movies, music, books, everything - the whole Wall Feed / Streaming generation
(although books seem to be slightly less affected).
Will there be any top songs of the 2010s in ten years?
Will there be any top Movies of the 2010s in ten years?
Will we ever have another Michael Jackson?
Moving forward will any of the culture we're creating - from private journals to favorite bands - be preserved?

To give you a taste of how far-reaching this problem may be, skim over
"[When Amazon Dies](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/when-amazon-dies/409387/)".

I'd of course like it to be the 00.03% that is piercing, moving, and deliberate that we save,
but I'm also concerned that we're just going to lose all of it wholesale.

Much like this post, it's going to disappear into the ever-scrolling abyss and simply... be gone.

P.S. Notice that it may also be in the corporate interest for us to *not* preserve [content].
New movies make money. New music makes money. New new new new new makes money.
In stark contrast to my generation's rise of nostalgic retromania remixes,
the act of re-reading, re-watching, and re-listening to something purchased isn't profitable.
In many ways, making the means for (or content with substance worth)
watching or listening to twice is the solemn enemy of the
