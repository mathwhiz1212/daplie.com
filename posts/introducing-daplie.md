I don't even know what to write here, so I'm just gonna do a stream-of-consciousness thing
and hope it turns out alright.

Hello, World!
-------------

I'm AJ ONeal and I believe that there is a better Internet waiting for us.

That's Internet with a capital 'I' not because old grammar books put it there
but because the Internet is a big idea with big potential - much bigger
than anything that can be done by the
[short list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_Internet_companies)
of companies that control most of its traffic - and so for this discussion it
deserves the full weight of that upper case letter.

I remember back in the day when I would download my email to my computer.
I would sync my photos to my computer.
I bought my music and stored it on my computer and my iPod.

I owned my stuff.

Somehow I let that get past me.

Now it seems like everything that I own is on someone else's computer - in "the cloud",
some far off magical wasteland where at the click of the button
and [56 pages](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-terms-and-conditions) of legal jargon
that I didn't actually read later... something?

Like you I was bamboozled in a sense.
I [sold my soul](https://www.google.com/search?q=user+agreement+sold+soul)
(among [other things](https://www.google.com/search?q=terrifying+user+agreements))
for quick convenience... and now we find ourselves in a state of
*digital indentured servitude*.
We're giving away ownership, privacy, security, and paying through the nose in high monthly fees
for our netizenship.

And yet time and time again we see that companies come and go. And when they go they take
our stuff with them.

Do you remember MySpace? How about Disney movies on Amazon? Lala? Simplify Media? Google Reader?

All gone and lost forever.

Netizenship Matters
-------------------

Bryson and I are **taking back the Internet** (again, capital 'I').
Or perhaps *giving* back the Internet.

We both hold similar principles to the folks over at Raspberry Pi Foundation -
in the same way that they want computers (representing knowlegde and hence power)
to be available to every person on the planet,
we want netizenship to come free of charge to every person on the planet.

To the point:

We are working towards a future where every piece of hardware can be part of the
true Internet under the terms and conditions of the person who owns it -
not us, not advertisers, but you.

Security, Ownership, Cost
------------------------

Whether you fancy Authenticity or Anonymity, I believe we can all agree that we
want security and, at least to some degree, the privacy it offers.

Security is a core tenant of Daplie. We want you, your family, and friends
to be able to enjoy peace of mind and privacy.

All the wallpapers in the world can't make up for bare walls, shelves, and living space.
There's something personal about *owning* a work of art, something very human.
Whether trinkets, tools, or toilet paper, we like to have stuff.

Ownership is a core tenant of Daplie's products. Although bits and bytes are something that
are hard to get a hold of, we want to provide you physical products for your digital life
and bring a measure of material and tangibility to the digital world.

Everything comes at a price. Nothing is truly free or without consequence. Even our very speech
costs us (or rewards us with) social currency. Some costs are fixed and others are recurring.
Some things cost personally while others cost only a finite dollar amount.

Cost is a core tenant of Daplie. Wealth is not a zero-sum game. For each of our products and
services we want the amount and type of cost to be clear and fair. We believe that we can provide
great products and services at prices, rates, and under terms that speak to their value without
depriving our customers of value, but truly adding.

This is Daplie.

Hello, World!
